	We give an overview of the foundations and the basic results of the classical \BN Theory, which deals with the geometry of the moduli varieties parametrizing effective divisors and linear series on a given curve.\\
	We mainly follow the treatment proposed in the book \emph{Geometry of Algebraic Curves} written by Arbarello, Cornalba, Griffiths and Harris. 
	The classical theory, as presented in the book, was developed for curves over the complex numbers during the last century.\\ 
	Our discussion, instead, avoids the use of any complex-analytic tool and it is completely formulated in terms of modern algebraic geometry. As a result of this more general approach, we are able to generalize two key results of the classical theory -- the Existence and Connectedness Theorems -- to curves over an arbitrary algebraically closed field.\\
	It is important to highlight that the \BN theory heavily relies on sheaf cohomology and abstract homological algebra and, in particular, a crucial role is played by the so called Petri's map, which is in fact a cohomolgical cup-product homomorphism. Motivated by these observations, it seems reasonable to expect the ideas described in the classical theory not to be strictly dependent on complex analysis and, thus, that most of the classical results can be extended to more general fields.
